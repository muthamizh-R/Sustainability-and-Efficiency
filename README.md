# Sustainability-and-Efficiency

Perfect idea âœ… â€” having a **README file** makes your project look professional when you submit/upload it (GitHub, AICTE portal, or even as part of your report).

Hereâ€™s a **ready-to-use README.md** for your **Energy Consumption Prediction** project:

# ðŸ“Š Energy Consumption Prediction â€“ AICTE Internship Project

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting household energy consumption** using machine learning techniques in **Jupyter Notebook**. By analyzing historical energy usage data, the model forecasts future consumption patterns. This helps in **improving energy efficiency, reducing wastage, and supporting sustainability goals (SDG 7: Affordable & Clean Energy)**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Objectives

* Analyze electricity consumption patterns.
* Build a predictive model for energy usage.
* Provide insights that can help reduce wastage and improve efficiency.
* Contribute towards sustainability and energy management.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset

* **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Household Power Consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
* **Features Used:**

  * `Global_active_power` (Target variable)
  * `Global_reactive_power`
  * `Voltage`
  * `Global_intensity`
  * Sub-metering features

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values.
   * Convert Date & Time into single `Datetime` column.
   * Convert numeric columns to proper format.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Daily & hourly energy consumption trends.
   * Correlation analysis between variables.

3. **Model Building**

   * Applied Linear Regression model.
   * Features: Voltage, Reactive Power, Global Intensity.
   * Target: Global Active Power.

4. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics: RMSE, RÂ² Score.
   * Visualization: Predicted vs Actual consumption.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results

* The model successfully predicted energy consumption trends.
* Visualizations showed patterns in daily & hourly consumption.
* Accuracy measured using RMSE and RÂ² Score.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Sustainability Impact

* Helps households and organizations **monitor & optimize energy usage**.
* Encourages **load shifting** to non-peak hours.
* Supports **energy efficiency and sustainability goals** by reducing wastage.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Future Scope

* Use advanced models (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet) for time-series forecasting.
* Develop a **Streamlit/Dash dashboard** for interactive predictions.
* Integrate with **IoT smart meters** for real-time monitoring.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download files.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
4. Load the dataset into the notebook.
5. Execute cells step by step to see preprocessing, analysis, and predictions.
